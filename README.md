# LocalLocator
## About The Project

This is the result of a semester long "Senior Project" that I worked on during the fall semester of the 2023 academic year.

### Summary

Getting approval for anything can be a nerve racking and irritating process. This is especially true when there is ambiguity about who needs to be contacted. For electricians who are ready to work, not knowing who to contact about a specific worksite is a regular occurrence that can be especially frustrating. LocalLocator is a mobile application that is designed to address this issue by centralizing contact information. 

Across the country, states are organized into locals, where jurisdiction and authority are given to union leaders. When beginning to work at a new site, electricians must communicate with and receive approval from the local in which the job site is located. Up until now, electricians had to work out on their own which local to contact.

LocalLocator is designed to allow users to simply search the address of a worksite in a map-like interface. The worksite along with boundary lines will be displayed on a map. Through this interface, users will be able to clearly understand where the searched location lies. After processing the search, LocalLocator will provide the website of the local that that worksite falls under. Once there, users can request approval and begin working, thus eliminating the irritating and inconvenient process of figuring out who to contact.
